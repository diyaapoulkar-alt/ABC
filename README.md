OVERVIEW OF PROJECT:
The project is a smart news assistant made in Python.
This tool is designed to provide users with customized news outputs based on interactive input.
Key Functionality:
1. Domain Selection: The smart news assistant begins by asking questions about which domain (topic) of news the user desires.
2. Language Selection: Following the domain query, the assistant asks for the language. The user is required to select the language.
3. Output: The final output of the code is the news about the entered topic.
In essence, the project functions as a query tool that allows users to specify both the subject matter and the language before receiving the relevant news results.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To clarify how the assistant works, you can think of it like a personalized news vending machine: You don't just get the day's headlines; you first select the exact category (the domain/topic, like selecting 'sports' or 'finance') and then select which language the information should be presented in (like selecting English or Spanish), ensuring the output you receive is precisely what you requested.

FEATURES:
Core Features of the Smart News Assistant
1. Smart Assistant Functionality: The project operates as a smart news assistant.
2. Technology Stack: It is made in Python.
3. Domain (Topic) Selection: The assistant initiates the interaction by asking questions about which domain news the user wants.
4. Mandatory Language Selection: The tool requires the user to specify the language; it asks for which language and the user has to select the language.
5. Targeted News Output: The primary function of the code is to deliver the news about the entered topic as its final output.
In essence, the assistant streamlines the process of finding specific news by requiring user input on both the subject matter and the language before generating the relevant results.

TECHNOLOGIES/TOOLS USED:

Steps to Install and Run the Project:
Prerequisites
This project is a smart news assistant made in python. You must have Python installed on your system to run the code.
• Python: Version X.X or newer (Please specify your minimum required Python version here).
Installation
1. Obtain the Code:
    ◦ [Insert specific instruction here, e.g., Clone the repository using git clone [repository_link] or download the ZIP file.]
2. Install Dependencies:
    ◦ [If your project requires external libraries (e.g., requests, newsapi, etc.), insert the command here, e.g., pip install -r requirements.txt.]
Running the Assistant
1. Navigate to the Project Directory:
2. Execute the Code:
    ◦ [Insert the execution command, e.g., python main_assistant.py]
3. Interact with the Assistant:
    ◦ The assistant will begin by asking questions about which domain news the user wants.
    ◦ The program then asks for which language.
    ◦ The user has to select the language.
    ◦ The final result, which is the output of the code, is the news about the entered topic.
   
Instructions for Testing:
Testing the Smart News Assistant involves executing the program and verifying that the core interactive selection process functions correctly, leading to a accurately filtered news output.
The project, which is a smart news assistant made in python, relies on two specific user inputs to deliver the final result.
1. Core Functionality Test Cases
To verify the successful operation of the assistant, follow these steps and observe the resulting output:
Test Case 1: Domain Selection Verification
1. Execute the Python script to start the assistant.
2. The program should immediately begin the interaction by asking questions about which domain news the user wants.
3. Enter a specific news topic (e.g., 'Sports' or 'Finance').
4. Proceed through the language selection step.
5. Expected Result: The final output of the code must be the news about the entered topic. Verify that the news content delivered directly corresponds to the domain you specified.
Test Case 2: Language Selection Verification (Mandatory Input)
1. Start the assistant again.
2. After responding to the domain query, the assistant will ask for which language.
3. The user has to select the language. Input a specific language (e.g., 'Spanish' or 'German').
4. Expected Result: Confirm that the news output, covering the domain selected, is presented in the specific language that the user was required to select.
Test Case 3: End-to-End Customization
1. Run the assistant and enter specific, distinct values for both inputs (e.g., Domain: 'Technology', Language: 'French').
2. Expected Result: The assistant should successfully process both customized inputs, resulting in a news output that covers 'Technology' and is delivered entirely in 'French'. This validates that both filtering mechanisms work simultaneously as intended.
